Flux comes in several parts:

-   the command-line client **fluxctl**
-   the daemon, **flux** which maintains the state of the cluster
-   a service, which runs in Weave Cloud

But you don't need the last to use Flux; you can just run the daemon
and connect to it with the command line client. This page describes
how.

# Quick Install

Clone the Flux repo and edit the example configuration in
[deploy/flux-deployment.yaml](../../deploy/flux-deployment.yaml). Then
create all the resources defined in the
[deploy directory](../../deploy/).

```
$EDITOR ./deploy/flux-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./deploy
```

Next, download the latest version of the fluxctl client [from github](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases).

Continue to [setup flux](./setup.md)

# Detailed Description

The deployment installs Flux and its dependencies. First, change to
the directory with the examples configuration.

```
cd deploy
```

## Memcache

Flux uses memcache to cache docker registry requests.

```
kubectl create -f memcache-dep.yaml memcache-svc.yaml
```

## Flux deployment

You will need to create a secret in which Flux will store its SSH
key. The daemon won't start without this present.

```
kubectl create -f flux-secret.yaml
```

The Kubernetes deployment configuration file
[flux-deployment.yaml](../../deploy/flux-deployment.yaml) runs the
Flux daemon, but you'll need to edit it first, at least to supply your
own configuration repo (the `--git-repo` argument).

```
$EDITOR flux-deployment.yaml
kubectl create -f flux-deployment.yaml
```

### Note for Kubernetes >=1.6 with role-based access control (RBAC)

You will need to provide fluxd with a service account which can access
the namespaces you want to use Flux with. To do this, consult the
example service account given in
[flux-account.yaml](../../deploy/flux-account.yaml) (which
puts essentially no constraints on the account) and the
[RBAC documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authorization/rbac/),
and create a service account in whichever namespace you put fluxd
in. You may need to alter the `namespace: default` lines, if you adapt
the example.

You will need to explicitly tell fluxd to use that service account by
uncommenting and possible adapting the line `# serviceAccountName:
flux` in the file `fluxd-deployment.yaml` before applying it.

## Flux API service

To make the pod accessible to the command-line client `fluxctl`, you
can create a service for Flux. The example in `flux-service.yaml`
exposes the service as a
[`NodePort`](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/services/#type-nodeport).

```
kubectl create -f flux-service.yaml
```

## Fluxctl

This allows you to control Flux from the command line, and if you're
not connecting it to Weave Cloud, is the only way of working with
Flux.

[from github](https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases).
